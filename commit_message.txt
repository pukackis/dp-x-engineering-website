fix: Improve styling of subpages for consistency and modern aesthetic

This commit addresses the styling issues on subpages, ensuring they align with the overall modern and professional design of the main page.
- Enhanced typography, spacing, and visual elements across all detailed subpages (About Us, Services, Work With Us, Contact, and all Portfolio project pages).
- Implemented specific styles for project detail sections (e.g., project-details-grid, project-info, project-section) to improve readability and visual appeal.
- Refined responsive adjustments for better display on various screen sizes.
