feat: Implement detailed subpages and enhanced navigation

This commit significantly expands the website's content and navigation:
- Created dedicated subpages for each main section (About Us, Services, Work With Us, Contact) in their respective directories (e.g., 'about/index.html').
- Developed a comprehensive portfolio section with a main listing page ('portfolio/index.html') and individual detail pages for each project (e.g., 'portfolio/electric-motor-housing.html').
- Updated the main 'index.html' to include "Read More" or "View All" buttons in each section, linking to their respective detailed subpages.
- Ensured all navigation links across the site correctly point to either anchor sections on the main page or to the new subpages.
- Added more detailed content and placeholder images to the new subpages.
