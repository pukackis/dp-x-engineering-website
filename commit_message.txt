feat: Implement dark mode and enhance hero background animation

This commit introduces a dark mode feature with a toggle switch in the header, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes. User preferences are saved in local storage.
Additionally, the pulsating background animation in the hero section has been enhanced to be more prominent and visually appealing.
