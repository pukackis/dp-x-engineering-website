feat: Convert website to single-page layout

This commit transforms the multi-page website into a single-page application:
- All content from 'about.html', 'services.html', 'portfolio.html', 'work.html', and 'contact.html' has been integrated into 'index.html' as distinct sections.
- Navigation links have been updated to use anchor links (e.g., '#about') for smooth scrolling to respective sections.
- The 'pages' directory and its contents have been removed as they are no longer needed for the main navigation.
